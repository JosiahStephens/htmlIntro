   BTW - never put a comment before the <!DOCTYPE html> all proper HTML files should begin with that DOCTYPE tag.
  
   Make sure you use the Beautify extension to format your HTML so that it's indented consistently. See "Tools needed for the course" in the content section of Learning Suite.

      <h2>What are dharks?</h2>
      <p>
        Dog sharks (<em>selachimorpha canis</em>), often called dharks, are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, three gill slits on the sides of the head, and wimpy arms that appear to serve no use. Due to their incredible mobility, dharks thrive in costal beaches and are found at depths of 5 metres. Since their discovery, they have been found all accross the pacific ocean and are commonly seen by tourists. These unique creatures are apex predators â€“ organisms at the top of their underwater food chain.

      <h2>Evolutionary history</h2>
      <h3>Origin</h3>
      <p>
        It is estimated that dharks first appeared in the late 1980's after decades of evolution. The earliest evidences of which were found in 2015 by American biologists Dave Limbean and Mike Stephens, Ph.D., while on an investigatory trip to the Pacific island of Aitutaki. These records indicate that the dhark originated from a shipwrecked pack of dogs lost at sea during the second world war. Based on probable scientific theory, hypothesized after extensive research by these scientists, it is believed that the dogs were unable to aquire food on the island and began to hunt in the shallow reefs. Over the next few years the dogs rapidly evolved to have gills and a rear fin.

      <h3>Fossil evidences</h3>
      <p>
        The following fossil discoveries were essential to our increasing our knowledge of dharks:

          Only one skeleton has been discovered that survived the many years since the first appearance of the dhark. This ancestor was very dog like and had slits on the side of its throat.

      The laser shark (<em>selachimorpha laseri</em>) is a close relative to the dhark, likely splitting evolutionarily in the 1960's.

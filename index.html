<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- 
  This is an HTML comment

  I generated the HTML page structure by using Emmet in VS Code. Either type HTML:5 and hit TAB or ! and TAB. See the HTML Template page in the Content section of Learning Suite for more info

   BTW - never put a comment before the <!DOCTYPE html> all proper HTML files should begin with that DOCTYPE tag.
  
   Make sure you use the Beautify extension to format your HTML so that it's indented consistently. See "Tools needed for the course" in the content section of Learning Suite.

   And don't forget to validate your page at https://validator.nu/ 
   Select the options "Show image report" which will display image alt text and "Show outline" so you make sure your headers are hierarchical. 
   Make sure you don't have any warnings or errors.

   Finally, if you make changes and re-upload your file, make sure to clear the browser cache with Ctrl-shift-R or Cmd-shift-R so that the changes will show
